100 | This use case is enormous, and must be broken down into numerous smaller tasks. It is expected that some of the tasks will be complex and might take a long time to implement
40 | This use case is large and can be broken down into quite a few tasks. Some tasks may be complex enough to be hard to estimate
20 | This use case is medium-sized, and a rough time for completion can be estimated
13 | This is a reasonably small use case, and a completion time can be estimated with some confidence
