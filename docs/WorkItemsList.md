# Priority Scale

Priority Value | Description
--- | ---
1 | This use case is either a fundamental part of the application, something the user absolutely needs or something that must be implemented before everything else (i.e. a dependency for other use cases). Priority description: Critical
2 | This use case is a very important piece of functionality for the user
3 | This use case would substantially improve the experience of the user
4 | This use case would be nice to have for the user, but not it is not especially necessary
5 | This use case would make the application more rich and feature-filled, but it only makes sense to work on it after all items with higher priority have been implemented

# Size Estimate Scale
Size Estimate Points | Description
--- | ---
100 | This use case is enormous, and must be broken down into numerous smaller tasks. It is expected that some of the tasks will be complex and might take a long time to implement
40 | This use case is large and can be broken down into quite a few tasks. Some tasks may be complex enough to be hard to estimate
20 | This use case is medium-sized, and a rough time for completion can be estimated
13 | This is a reasonably small use case, and a completion time can be estimated with some confidence
8 | This use case is small enough to be able to guarantee an estimated time of completion
5 | This use case is small enough to complete in a single iteration
3 | This use case is small enough to complete in a week
1 | This use case is small enough to complete in a day
