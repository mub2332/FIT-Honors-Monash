# Project Management Plan
This is the project management plan for Team Shotgun Surgery. This plan is designed to give an idea of how the process of the entire plan will go. 
Every member of the team should thoroughly understand the process model that will be documented in this plan. For now, deployment and the lessons learnt
areas of the OpenUP model seems irrational to add in at this stage because the project hasn't progressed to the point that these fields exist.

# Introduction
The problem faced by Monash currently is that the current system that handles final year students project is slow, inefficient and filled with bottlenecks.
Satisfying all user requirements by utilising the fastest and most cost efficient way. The vision we have for this project is that it should be accessible 
using any platform. After thorough research, we decided to use the OpenUP process model for the numerous benefits it can propose to the small team we have
developing this software. Also, the software should be as user friendly as possible and accessible anywhere in the world. Ultimately, this software should
eventually be the actual software used by Monash to run a smoother experience for final year Honours students navigating available final year projects.

# Project Practices and Measurements
Our team has adapted most OpenUP components to suit our project. This process model is fluid and complements the fact that we have a small team.
Key artifacts are stated below in the release plan.
Progress is tracked using two primary measurements using a point system. It is estimated that 1 point represents 2h of work:
<ul><li>Project backlog: The project backlog shows progress relative to overall work to be done within the project.<li><ul>
Iteration backlog: The iteration backlog shows progress relative to work intended for the current iteration.
