# Introduction
The system to be built is a large enterprise application used to manage honors projects for Monash University. It will consist of modules that will interact with each other through a service protocol - in other words, a service-oriented architecture. This document is meant to outline all the system-wide requirements this application must fulfill in order to meet client expectations.

# System-Wide Functional Requirements
- Authentication: A user must be authenticated as a Monash Honors/Masters candidate or a faculty member with the prerequisite permissions before being permitted access to the system.


- User Roles: A faculty member must have different access rights and responsibilities from those of a student. There must also be an Admin Role for the Honors Coordinator


# System Qualities


## Usability
The quality of a user interface can be the difference between success and failure. A user should be able to connect every UI element with its purpose intuitively - they should not have to think deeply about what they are doing. The system will be designed with this tenet in mind, and make it so that the user experience is as unobtrusive as possible. The key features we will make sure to provide are listed below:


- The system needs to account for people with disabilities, such as color blindness
- The system should be as simple as possible to reduce cognitive load in daily use
- The system needs to space UI elements so that the users' attention is immediately drawn to the most important information
- The system should utilize fonts in such a way as to increase clarity and smooth over the user experience
- The UI elements should be consistent to help reduce the learning curve for using the system
- The system needs to provide feedback to the user as frequently as possible to make sure they always know what to do next
- The system should provide defaults whenever possible, such as automatically filling certain fields on a form, to reduce the work users have to do
