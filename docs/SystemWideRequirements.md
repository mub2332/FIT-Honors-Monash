# Introduction
The system to be built is a large enterprise application used to manage honors projects for Monash University. It will consist of modules that will interact with each other through a service protocol - in other words, a service-oriented architecture. This document is meant to outline all the system-wide requirements this application must fulfill in order to meet client expectations.

# System-Wide Functional Requirements
- Authentication: A user must be authenticated as a Monash Honors/Masters candidate or a faculty member with the prerequisite permissions before being permitted access to the system.


- User Roles: A faculty member must have different access rights and responsibilities from those of a student. There must also be an Admin Role for the Honors Coordinator
