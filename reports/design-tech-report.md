# Technical Report - Design

## Summary

This report is meant to elaborate on the nuances involved in building an application using a service-oriented architecture. It will outline the advantages and disadvantages of such an approach, what is involved in the workflow, how such an architecture functions from both a high-level and low-level point of view, and whether following such an approach truly is the optimal approach to be taken for the Honors Project Management System.

## Introduction

## Overview

- ### Advantages

- Each Service is self contained and independent, leading to certain advantages:
    - Re-usability of Services
        - Since each service is self contained and independent to carry out their own specific functions/tasks, they can be reused on other applications without having to make modifications the service
            itself. Take a real life example, if a cup provides a service to hold water, it can have its designed unmodified to store other beverages as well (milk, soft drinks etc.) [10]
    - Maintainability
        - Upgrading, fixing and modifying services is flexible as there is no worry of affecting interactions between services, leading to lesser complications to even complex environments. [10]
    - Easier debugging and unit testing [10]
    - Reducing costs
        - Since each service is reusable as mentioned above, there is no need for software module to be written if a module that provides a similar service already exists. Saving time and money, hence, increasing productivity and efficiency. [12]
- Portability
    - Each service is "Platform Independent", which means that servies can provide public availabilities to most systems. This also leads to a reduction in complications when integrating services regardless of their platforms.
- SOA is considered as one of the more popular architectures, which means that there are already existing tools that are able to support the "utilisation and integration" of an entire SOA cycle. [12]


- ### Drawbacks
    - SOA requires a stable network connection with decent networking speed for it to be useful [11]
    - Difficult to track activity within SOA
        - The SOA process requires "illogical steps" that may lead to software module containing millions of executables. This makes it very difficult to track SOA activities as it has made it more complicated for the user and the machine to manage the interaction of services. [13]
        - Due to this, the SOA process requires good control, quality and management [11]


- ### Why would we use or not use SOA?
- ##### Situtaions that are suitable for SOA
    - When services are expected to be reused, to increase productivity [11]
- ##### Situations that are not suitable for SOA

    

## Essential Components of an SOA Architecture
- Service module
    - Each of the service module which divided in the business process model. It performs part of the application, it must have clear subsystem boundaries, autonomous and loosely coupled design to allow reuse, add, delete module from the system.[9]
- Adapter
    - Added to application to enable access to service through each interface.[9]
- Enterprise Service Bus
    - A data line connecting between service module, middleware, database and other component in the system to enable communication and service.
- Service Broker
    - A monitoring system ensure each service module has no error.
- Business Process Module
    - A map state all the relationship of each component in the SOA architecture.[9]

## Roles of SOA components
- The Enterprise Service Bus is arguably the most important component in a SOA. It connects components of the system together, making sure that data is passed to and from components [15]:
	- It connects to the applications and systems of the software. This is done possible through adapters, which allows access to their capabilities, also allowing them to communicate with each other. [16]
	<br/>
	- It connects to the SOA Registry, which is the "Central Reference Point" of a SOA. This means that a SOA Registry plays the role of taking record of components that are ready or available. The SOA Registry also helps programmers and analysts select components and helping them connect them with each other. It helps find the services that are needed. [15]
	<br/>
	- The service broker is in charge of making the connections between components and making sure that they work properly, sometimes the Enterprise Service Bus can play the role of a service broker as well, so a standalone broker is not always required [15]
	
	
## Service provision technologies

- SOAP: A vendor-agnostic technology used for communication between different application components or services via HTTP using an XML-based messaging format. SOAP message formats typically use WSDL as the XML implementation for describing the interface of a web service. [1]

    A SOAP design must adhere to the following constraints:

    - A formal contract must be established to describe the interface of the web service. This is typically done using WSDL, and will include details such as messages, operations, bindings and the location of the web service. [2]
    - The architecture must address complex non-functional requirements such as transaction management, security, addressing, trust, coordination, etc. [2]
    - The architecture needs to support asynchronous processing and invocation. The infrastructure for such capabilities can be provided by standards such as WSRM and APIs such as JAX-WS. [2]


- REST: An architectural style that specifies constraints to be applied to web services that help improve non-functional requirements such as performance, scalability and modifiability if followed correctly. Data and functionality are considered resources in this architectural style, and are accessed using URIs, which are typically links on the Web. REST services use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP. [3]

    The REST architectural style adheres to the following principles:

    - Resource identification using URI: URIs are used to identify each resource needed by the service to function. A REST API would thus have a URI for every entity it makes available to consumers. [3]
    - Uniform interface: All resources allow only a fixed set of operations: PUT, GET, POST and DELETE. These correspond to the CRUD operations used widely in databases. PUT creates a new resource, while DELETE erases it. GET retrieves the current state of a specified resource, and POST overwrites the state of an existing resource. [3]
    - Self-descriptive messages: Resources are decoupled from their representation, and enough metadata is provided that the content can be decoded, whether they be in XML, JSON or any other format. [3]
    - Stateful interactions through hyperlinks: Every interaction with a resource is stateless. So, request messages need to carry the information about state that they need to perform their designated functionality. [3]


## Data Transfer using Web Services

Web services commonly transfer data in one of two formats - XML or JSON. Each has its own set of advantages and drawbacks, both of which have been outlined below.

#### XML
XML is a markup language that has similar syntax to HTML and was designed to be both human and machine readable. [4]

###### Advantages
- XML stores data in a structured format that enables parse routines to function even when extra data is added or existing data is removed, unlike HTML. [4]

###### Drawbacks
- XML contains many characters devoted strictly to formatting, so it can waste considerable space, which can be a significant drawback for mobile devices in particular. [4]
- Parsing XML can be slow as parsers would need to check tags to determine the purpose of the data contained within.

#### JSON
JSON is a text-based data interchange format derived from the Javascript programming language. [4]

###### Advantages
- JSON stores data as key-value pairs, so it takes up a lot less space than XML, as it is more focused on content than formatting. [4]
- JSON is faster as less computation is needed to parse it since it stores data in a minimalist fashion.

###### Drawbacks
- JSON can be hard to read for humans.
- It is not feasible for humans to type out JSON as they could with XML.

## Client-Service Interaction

Most of the interactions between service consumers and service providers are web service conversations. [14] To elaborate, Conversational Web Services can be interpreted as primitive, single request/response type interactions.

These interactions vary from service to service and therefore it is critical to recognize each client interaction properly to ensure the client is able to acquire the service they intended. A brief description of how it works

would be the client sending a request to the server to execute a task, this in itself is a form of a web service conversation. The server proceeds to execute the task by calling all necessary interactions, which are all considered

as Conversational Web Services between the server and relevant parties it interacts with. After receiving the callback information, the server closes those conversations and resumes it's conversation with the client.

## Stateless Services

## Microservices

Microservices architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of lowly coupled services. [5] A service is a function that is self-contained and does not have any relation to other services.[6]

Microservices do not share data. Each service has their own database that is not made public to the other services. This is to ensure low coupling between services.

#### Advantages
-	Services can be developed by different teams independently as there is no shared database. 
-	Each team is free to implement/modify anything at anytime without interfering with or being affected by other teamsâ€™ progression.
-	Enable continuous delivery/deployment of large, complex applications.[5]
-	Easy to test the functionality of each service.[8]

#### Drawbacks
-	It is much more difficult to integrate all services into the final application since the data of each service is not shared with other services.[8]
-	Difficult to perform integration testing as each service is totally isolated from other services.[8]

Based on the information above and the situation where no one team is confident enough to manage a database that is shared among all team, we should use microservices in our project. Although it will be more complex on sharing data to other databases, it still has more advantages than drawbacks.

Using microservices, each team can handle their own database and can implement relevant functionality for their part without being interrupted by other team's progress.

## Managing dependencies between services

Dependencies between services are managed by sagas. A saga is a sequence/step of local transaction. Each local transaction updates the database of the current service used and sends a signal to trigger the next local transaction in other services to start.[7]

There are two different types of sagas:
- Choreography â€“ each local transaction sends a signal to trigger the next local transaction in other services.[7]
- Orchestration â€“ An object will tell all the related services to a given event what local transactions to execute.[7]

## Recommendations

## Conclusion

After thorough research, as presented above, we have decided to go with SOA because the pros outweigh the cons for our project. Looking back, we understand the advantages that only SOA can bring to the table and wish to fully utilise them. The alternatives fell

short of the mark. We fully believe that using this architecture for our project will yield effective and efficient results.
