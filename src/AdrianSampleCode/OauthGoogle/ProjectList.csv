Consequently it is essential that the computationally-expensive simulation step must be taken out of the evaluation loop. There are two possible ways of achieving this:",,This project is most suited for students with good mathematical and modelling skills,"Investigate a gas turbine combined cycle power station to understand the number of processing units, the parameters applicable to each unit, the model associated with each unit, and the model associated with the plant (simplified as necessary to meet the project timescale).  Investigate  approach  2,  above,  and  compare  the  results  achievable  with  this  approach  with those achieved by previous researchers using the NSGA-II algorithm on the same problem."

Online Handwritten Signature Verification,Supervisors: Gopal Gupta,"There is considerable interest in authentication based on handwritten signature verification (HSV) because HSV is superior to many other biometric authentication techniques , for example, fingerprints or retinal pattern which are more reliable but much more intrusive.",,The student must have some mathematical background and experience in programming,A number of HSV techniques have been explored over the last 30-40 years. I myself have looked into using dynamic parameters when a signature is signed online. Another approach was based on simulating the hand movements of the person signing online. Both these techniques work well and the results have been published. This project involves finding even more reliable techniques perhaps by exploring yet another approach to online HSV based on identifying curves and straight lines as the signature is signed. You will need to study curves and lines identification techniques in pattern recognition and then use those techniques and perhaps develop new techniques for use in online HSV. The project requires some mathematical knowledge and programming experience.

Visualising Lazy Functional Program Execution,Supervisors: Tim Dwyer and Chris Mears,To develop novel interactive visualisation tools to support programmers in understanding the efficiency and memory use of running haskell programs.,,"Some knowledge of functional programming would be very useful (ideally haskell, but Lisp/ML/etc are also a good foundation). An interest in graphics, visualisation and software usability would also be advantageous.","Pure lazy functional programming languages such as Haskell remain the most advanced programming paradigm in common use. Laziness and functional purity allow the compiler to optimise code in much more sophisticated ways than standard imperative language compilers. Haskell syntax is also, arguably, a more natural and concise way to model problems and algorithms for solving them. However, the difficulty for programmers in these types of languages is understanding what is actually happening with such compiled, optimised code when it is executing. This is a serious blocker to wider adoption of the pure functional paradigm. While a lot of the research in functional languages over the years has been devoted to language and compiler design, it seems less effort has gone into developing really “user friendly” practical tools for developers. There is some recent work in this direction (see links to IHaskell and ghc-vis) however much work remains in making such tools informative and interactive."

Software Tools for the Manipulation of 3D Image Content,Supervisors: Peter Tischer and Carlo Kopp,"Computer displays and televisions built for the presentation of 3D (stereoscopic) content are now becoming commodity hardware products, rather than specialised research support products. The market for 3D products is driven mostly by the entertainment sector, and in computer displays, the dominant market for 3D displays and supporting graphics adaptors is the computer gaming market, with several hundred products now capable of driving a 3D display. Responding to the market, hardware vendors are now producing 3D LED displays for desktop and deskside computers, or high performance notebooks with 3D LED displays and infrared emitters for 3D glasses built into the notebook. Concurrently, stereoscopic (3D) cameras are re-emerging in the market, with two products now available. While hardware for displaying 3D content is now becoming affordable and common, there is a shortage of software tools available for manipulating 3D content, especially 3D digital imagery produced by stereo cameras. Extant proprietary software tools like Photoshop, Aperture, Lightroom, Optics Pro, and GPL tools like GIMP lack proper support, or provide at best rudimentary support for 3D imagery.",,A student will not need to have studied image processing or computer graphics at undergraduate level,"The aim of this project is to produce an Open Source software tool and capable of converting, parallax adjusting, displaying and exporting imagery in common stereoscopic formats. The tool must be highly portable and integration with GIMP would be highly desirable. The overall objective of the project is to produce an image editor for 3D images. The initial implementation will enable operations to be carried out on 3D images or the fields of stereoscopic images. The tool should be designed in such a way that it can be turned into a full editing tool that will allow operations to be carried out on components of images. It is expected the prototype will operate on nVidia 3D adaptors and 120 Hz 3D monitors."

Profiling Public Transport Users on Social Media.,"Supervisors: Sue Bedingfield, Marc Cheong and Kerri Morgan","The aim of this project is to identify types of Public Transport (PT) users who are active on social media, their views on the PT system and to measure their engagement in this system. In particular, groups of people that are concerned about specific areas of the PT system. The source of information about public transport users will be obtained from social media data from Twitter. A list of seed users will be gathered in two ways: Firstly, identify all official Victorian Public Transport Twitter accounts, then the users who communicate with these accounts. Secondly, identify anyone who has tweeted about public transport in Victoria.",,"Potential students should have skills in data mining and statistics, a basic understanding of the Victorian PT system, and an interest in applying these skills to social media analysis. Interested students, please talk to Kerri, Marc and Sue.",Two types of information will be gathered: the metadata of the users (available from Twitter) and text data from the tweets themselves obtained by text mining using RapidMiner or other software. The types of users commenting on public transport will then be profiled using clustering techniques on each of these domains. Cross-clustering techniques may be used to integrate these results.

Inference of ecological species distribution models,Supervisors: David Dowe and Prof. Lewi Stone (RMIT),"This project will attempt to derive innovative statistical tools to improve our understanding of species distributions. These models predict the spatial distribution of all individuals of a particular species within its potential geographic range. The models are generally fitted to observed spatial survey data of a single species together with local measurements of environmental or geographical conditions that might potentially influence species’ occurrence or location (e.g., temperature, rainfall or elevation). Predictions of a species’ spatial distribution may then be computed under different environmental scenarios, such as modifying the SDM's environmental parameters to reflect hypothetical climate or land use changes. Having the ability to predict the likely locations of a species under different environmental scenarios is important for a wide range of conservation management and policy contexts, including the management of threatened species, assessing the impact of development scenarios, determining biodiversity “hotspots,” and predicting the likely ranges of invasive species. Very few models proposed for the analysis of these data-sets account for the effects of errors in detection of individuals, even though nearly all surveys of natural populations are prone to detection errors, which can be significant. Failure to account for imperfect detectability in models can induce bias in the parameters and predictions. This is an exciting challenge for which solutions are sought.",,Essential: Mathematics to at least 1st year university level.,"D. L.

Multi-class classification with Bayesian Networks,Supervisors:  Wray Buntine and Francois Petitjean,At Monash we have developed a state of the art classifier that extends the naive Bayes classifier by building a Bayesian network.,,Good Python skills to do basic text munging and text database manipulation. Basic understanding of probabilistic models to gain an understanding of what the algorithm does.  General practical machine learning knowledge. Flair for scripting and experimenting.   Good experience with Java would be beneficial but not essential.,"How could we apply this to multi-class and/or multi-label classification? The idea is to try a number of task decompositions and test them out. So we would manipulate datasets in different ways to build different structures using the software, in order to achieve different variants of a classifier.  The project would involve conceiving different approaches, massaging the inputs and outputs of the software to achieve this, running experiments and analysis."
